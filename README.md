# The IMDb Web Scraper

**Addapted by**: [Willian Herreira Lima](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willianherreira/).

To build this model I did follow the step-by-step guide written by [Angeliga Dietzel](https://medium.com/better-programming/the-only-step-by-step-guide-youll-need-to-build-a-web-scraper-with-python-e79066bd895a) and published on medium.com. The entire [template code](https://github.com/angelicadietzel/data-projects/blob/master/single-page-web-scraper/imdb_scraper.py) is available at Angeliga's data-project folder.  

What is web scraping? Web scraping consists of gathering data available on websites to build your own databases, it is a powerful tool to have on your portfolio. Some scrapers can be started manually or be automatically triggered by a function call.

The article is really interesting, it covers topics such as understanding HTML web pages, building a web scraper using Python, and creating a DataFrame with pandas. It also covers data quality, data cleaning, and data-type conversion, it is an entirely step-by-step and with instructions, code, and explanations on how every piece of it works. I did add a few twists to my model, first I did add the “Director” to the data storage, and a nested “for loop” to build a list of urls.
